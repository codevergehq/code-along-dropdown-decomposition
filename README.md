# Select Decomposition

This is an React App that showcases a somewhat smushed down version of a custom select component. During the code-along, we will break down the component into smaller, more manageable parts.

A working demo can be found at [https://select-decomposition.codewith.codeverge.de/](https://select-decomposition.codewith.codeverge.de/).

By the end of the code-along, you should have a good understanding of how to break down a complex component into smaller, more manageable parts.


This app is part of the [Web Development Bootcamp](https://codeverge.de/) at Codeverge.
